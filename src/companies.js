Consequently, the company has created a few employee resource groups as networks for women in technology to develop and support female employees at Microsoft through opportunities such as global conferences, networking events, and mentoring called Women at Microsoft. Women at Microsoft also partners with MentorNet, a company that seeks to connect STEM student to mentors in their community.
